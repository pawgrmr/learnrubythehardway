# What You Should Test

# For Exercise 49, write a complete test that confirms everything in this code is working. That includes making exceptions happen by giving the parser bad sentences.

# Check for an exception by using the function assert_raise from the Test::Unit documentation. Learn how to use this so you can write a test that is expected to fail, which is very important in testing. Learn about this function (and others) by reading the Test::Unit documentation.

# When you are done, you should know how this bit of code works and how to write a test for other people's code even if they do not want you to. Trust me, it's a very handy skill to have.
